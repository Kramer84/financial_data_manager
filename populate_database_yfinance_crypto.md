The script provided is written in Python and utilizes the `yfinance` library for downloading cryptocurrency data. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. Imports the necessary libraries: `yfinance` for retrieving data, `datetime` for working with dates and times, and `os` for file and directory operations.

2. Defines the `master_path` variable, which represents the directory path where the downloaded data will be stored.

3. Defines two lists: `CRYPTO_CURRENCIES` containing the cryptocurrencies of interest, and `INTERVALS` containing the time intervals for data retrieval.

4. Initializes an empty list called `parameters` to store the combinations of cryptocurrency and interval.

5. Iterates over each cryptocurrency and interval combination to create a list of parameters.

6. Prints the `parameters` list to display all the combinations of cryptocurrencies and intervals.

7. Retrieves the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()` and calculates the start dates for data retrieval. `start_720d` represents a time delta of 720 days (approximately 2 years), and `start_60d` represents a time delta of 60 days.

8. Loops through each parameter in the `parameters` list and attempts to download the corresponding cryptocurrency data.

9. If the data is empty for the given parameter, it attempts to download data for the past 60 days instead.

10. Checks if the directory for the specific cryptocurrency exists in the `master_path` and creates it if it doesn't.

11. Constructs the file name using the `master_path`, cryptocurrency name, interval, and saves the downloaded data to a CSV file with tab-separated values.

12. If any errors occur during the data retrieval process, such as a `KeyError`, it will be printed.

Overall, this script downloads cryptocurrency data for the specified cryptocurrencies and time intervals, and saves them as CSV files in the designated directory.
